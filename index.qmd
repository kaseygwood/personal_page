## Bio

My name is Kasey Wood and I am from midcoast Maine. I am graduating with a B.S. in data science at [St. Lawrence University](https://www.stlawu.edu/){target="_blank"} in May 2024. The best experience I had was attending the St. Lawrence Kenya program for a semester. I am on the women's rugby team at SLU and have held various E-board positions. My skills include python programming, java programming, R programming, SQL, as well as applied statistics and regression analysis. I am currently searching for a post-undergraduate job in my discipline.
